# Handpaint

Little Project to show some basic programming skills

Put your hand in front of the Webcam. 
Let the program identify the joints. 
When making a fist for around 3 seconds, a change in navigation is triggered (and a different shape is painted).

To set up a new react-project:
Create a Folder and open it in Visual Studio Code
npx create-react-app handpaint
change dir into handpaint
add imports in App.js
npm install 
npm start
